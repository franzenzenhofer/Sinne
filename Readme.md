#Sinne - simple Eyes and Ears for modern Browsers

note: "Sinne" is the german word for senses. 

Sinne is a small, cross-browser CoffeeScript/JS library for making getUsereMedia really simple. 


**Sinne** it introduces two simple functions

`Sinne.getUserVideo(success, error[, options])` and `Sinne.getUserAudio(success, error[, options])`

these are two high-level functions that gives you easy access to the camera or microphone of your users.

**Sinne** also introduces a not so simple function, called

`Sinne.getUserMedia(options, success, error)` 

which basically is a cross-browser implementation of `navigator.getUserMedia(…)` and the backbone of getUserVideo and getUserAudio.

##TL;DR
`Sinne.getUserVideo(success, error[, options])` calls `success(videoEl, stream)` gives you a ready to use HTML5 video element with the users camera as the input. 

please see the demos for <a href="https://github.com/franzenzenhofer/Sinne/blob/master/demo/video.html">getUserVideo</a> and <a href="https://github.com/franzenzenhofer/Sinne/blob/master/demo/audio.html">getUserAudio</a>

##where does it work?

a the current state of cross-browser compatibility is a very sad and disturbing affair, cross browser means

 * no flash fallback 
 * only works in browsers that support some kind of `getUsereMedia`
 * works in google chrome 21 and up
 * works in google chrome canary
 * works in current firefox nightly builds, if you have <a href="http://www.browsomatic.com/2012/07/firefox-16-now-supports-html5.html">enabled getUsereMedia</a>
 * works in opera next

tested on a macbook air with lion

##what works?

`Sinne.getUserVideo(success, error[, options])` works great over all tested platforms.

`Sinne.getUserAudio(success, error[, options])` works in the FF nightyl builds, in some -very disturbing - way, sometimes (think echo of an echo of an echo … echo all the way down)

why does it not work in other browsers? well, because it <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=112367">isn't implemented yet</a>.

but `Sinne.getUserVideo(…)` is a fine, good working function that believes in a days pay for a days work, so there is no reason not to use it. 


##finally: how does it work?

the whole idea behind `Sinne.getUserVideo(success, error[, options])` is, if i want to access the camera, i want a video. 

and similar if i want to access the microphone, i want an audio back.

so `Sinne.getUserVideo(success, error[, options])` calls the `success` callback with these arguments `success(videoEl, stream)` where videoEL is an HTML5 video element, and `stream` is some kind of low level MediaStream object (or based on the browser-implementation some kind of different stream, god knows why….)

so basically you can do your fancy stuff with `videoEl` element, if you want to go low-level, just use `stream`

the same goes for `Sinne.getUserAudio(success, error[, options])` but guess what, instead of an video you get a fresh new HTML5 audio element. (yeah)

`Sinne.getUserVideo(success, error[, options])` the `option` part of is basically a config object that get copied upon the video (or audio) element. 

ok, the option object can do more, i.e. see the default option object

```javascript
  default_options = {
    autoplay: true
    controls:true
    init: (element) -> 
      element.play()
      element.addEventListener('error', (e)->error({
        name:'init_didnt_work'
        message:'initialzing the '+e.srcElement+' didn\'t work out'
        sinne_error_id: 4
        }))
  }
``` 

it also include an `init` function that gets called after the video/audio element was created. (and creates another useful error listener to catch even more error)

**note**: if you provide your own options object please note, that your options and the default_options gets merged, not replaced.  

**note**: another special case is the option `audio:true`, if you provide the `Sinne.getUserVideo` with this option, it will enable both camera and microphone.

**note**: please note, **the success and error handlers are not optional**. especially mind the error handler, `getUserMedia` will throw errors, you need to have proper error handling in place, that's why i made the error handler mandatory. if you refuse to call any of the three methods without proper error handling, the method will just `return false`

thx to <a href="https://github.com/addyosmani/getUserMedia.js">addy osmani</a> for his <a href="https://github.com/addyosmani/getUserMedia.js">getUserMedia shim</a>, i did reuse his code heavily (but not the flash part, once you go down the flash road there is no hope, and what are we without hope?)
